How to run the Paw Portal web app:

A. With an IDE
	1. Download a Java-based IDE if you do not have an IDE ready (Recommended IDEs include: Intellij, Eclipse, NetBeans; Intellij will be the main IDE used for the explanations below)
	2. Open up the IDE and then open up the project folder containing this README file, "paw-portal" with "File"->"Open" or the equivalent version opening projects in your respective IDE
	3. On the left-hand side of the IDE, you should see the folder named "paw-portal" with a dropdown arrow inside the "Project" window. Click the dropdown arrows in the following order to open the folders up: "paw-portal"->"src"->"main"->"java"->"edu"->"psu"->"sweng"->"pawportal"
	4. Double-click on the "PawPortalApplication" .java file that has appeared in the "Project" window and the file should open up in the center of the IDE
	5. Right-click inside the text area of the "PawPortalApplication.java" file and then click on "Run 'PawPortalApplication'" to start running the web app. The IDE's console should appear and some text should appear in that console
	6. After the console text stops moving, open up a web browser (Google Chrome and FireFox are recommended)
	7. In the URL section of the browser, type in "http://localhost:8080/" or simply "localhost:8080" to open the web app
